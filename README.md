# Linear Algebra Fundamentals for Machine Learning

Welcome to the Linear Algebra Fundamentals for Machine Learning repository! This repository is designed to provide a foundational understanding of linear algebra concepts essential for machine learning applications. Through Jupyter Notebooks, we explore vector basics, vector projections, basis vectors, introduction to matrices, and Gaussian elimination. I was motivated by my experience with the LinkedIn Learning course titled "Machine Learning Foundations: Linear Algebra," instructed by Terezija Semenski.

## Introduction

Linear algebra is a fundamental mathematical framework that underlies many machine learning algorithms. In this repository, we focus on key concepts that lay the groundwork for understanding more advanced topics in linear algebra and their applications in machine learning.

## Notebooks

Explore the following Jupyter Notebooks in this repository:

- Vectors Basics: Introduction to vectors, their representation, and basic operations.

- Vector Projections and Basis: Understanding vector projections onto other vectors and the concept of a vector basis.

- Introduction to Matrices: Exploring matrices, their representation, and basic operations.

- Gaussian Elimination: Learning the Gaussian elimination method for solving systems of linear equations.

Feel free to delve into these notebooks to grasp the essentials of linear algebra and their direct relevance to machine learning.
